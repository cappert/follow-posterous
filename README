THIS IS AN IDEA :

STEP 1
? sign-up / lazy signup ? no signup and thus anarchy and the annihilation of mankind ?
STEP 2
create a new tumblr blog with a funny looking id, like : follow-posterous-82738325
hint : look at any URL produced by a Microsoft product.
STEP 3
makes the user follow the tumblr blog you've just created
STEP 4
populate this blog with articles from the posterous blogs the user wants to follow
STEP 5
Huge success !!
This is usually the step where money starts to fall from the ceiling and hot, naked girls begin to stalk you.

/!\ Important : you don't necessarily need / want the tumblr username / password
you could use one's *posterous* user/password and use the posterous API :
http://posterous.com/api/reading
maybe posterous even implement some sort of dashboard thing
I DON'T KNOW I DON'T CARE
